      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I am <strong>Jason Graves</strong> (not the composer) from Whitney Point, New York, but moved to Florida when I was 21 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in software development from Valencia College in Orlando FL, and have in the past been employed as a <strong>Software Developer</strong>, a <strong>Plumber</strong>, a <strong>Video Editor</strong>, and a <strong>Subway Manager</strong>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      I'm in my late 20s, looking for work, and would like my next job to be my career forever. Open to development, video/media production, data analysis, IT, video editing, or any other interesting opportunities.
<h2>My Background</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> -B.A.S. in Software Development,<br>
            &nbsp;-A.S. In computer Programming,<br>
            &nbsp;-Both from Valencia College. 3.2 overall GPA. <br>
            &nbsp;-NYS Advanced Regents High School Diploma from Whitney Point HS.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            <li><strong>Experience:</strong> I've had a wide variety of jobs and with those have learned gobs about work ethic and life.&nbsp; &nbsp; </li>
           
            <li><strong>YouTube:</strong> I have a channel focused on retro (before 2000 mostly) video games, that has over 20,000 subscribers!

</li>
        </ul>
<h2>Favorite STUFF</h2>
      <li>I LOVE old video games, but I'm down for any old media whatsoever. This website is a throwback to the first time I ever used a computer.</li>
       <li>A few of my favorite games are, Chrono Trigger, Zelda 2, Dark Souls, Deadly Premonition, Rocket League, NCAA football 14, Tony Hawk Underground.</li>
<li>I also follow basketball and football, more college than pro. As a kid my family had Syracuse season tickets and I still rarely miss a game (on TV). For pros my favorites are Chicago teams, Bulls and Bears (even though I've never been.) </li>
      <li>Youtube is my other favorite thing, not just my channel, but I love the spirt of the place and all the random junk you can find there. I'm especially interested in odd individuals who don't recieve many views. Finding these people is a long pastime of mine.</li>
     <li>The 2 dollar bill is a low key obsession of mine. I have hundreds of dollars worth, as well as an uncut sheet of bills ordered directly from the government. </li>
		<li>Comic Sans ;)</li>
<h2>The Straight FAX</h2>
        <li>I drive barefoot 90% of the time, but also have a decent basketball sneaker collection.</li>
        <li>Once scored 42 points in a HS basketball game (JV... but still counts!)</li>
		<li>4 year first chair Trombone in HS.</li>
		<li>Never had alcohol or weed or smoked or anything like that.</li>
		<li>The TV used for this website is a Panasonic AG-500, I do not have one, <strong>BUT</strong> I hope to aquire one some day... It's my dream TV, I'm the type of guy who has a dream TV.</li>
		<li>Scared of needles.</li>
		<li>Scared of boats.</li>
		
		<h2>Philosophies</h2>
		<li>When unsure what to do, <strong>choose the most interesting option.</strong> Life is too short to take the boring route.</li>
		<li>You only go as far as you're willing to work.</li>
		<li>Nobody knows anything.</li>
		<li>Keep it simple, stupid.</li>
		<li>The shortest path to the endzone is a straight line.</li>
		<li>Like Ed Wood, it's all about the big picture.</li>
		<li>Do stuff for the plot.</li>
		<li>Don't bullshit yourself.</li>
